# HyperionDev
This Repository is for HyperionDev Marketplace Reviewer Take-Home Test.
It contains three sections: Section A: Code Review, Section B: Projects, and, Section C: Code Challenge.
As instructed, I have to use different programming language for Section A and C. 
Also, I have to choose one option from Sections A and C, while Section B is a project I am most proud of.

Section A
For this section, I use Python.

Section B
Submit the best previous project.
Here, I chose one of my favourite projects I had worked on previously, HR Analytics: Job Change of Data Scientists.

Section C
For this Section, I used R programming language.
I chose option 1(Say the Number: Write R function that converts numbers to words, from 0 to 999,999,999,999,999).
